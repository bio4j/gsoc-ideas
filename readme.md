# Bio4j - Google Summer of Code ideas

## How this works

- ideas are issues
- labels categorize these ideas in terms of requirements, difficulty, knowledge area, etc
- possible mentor/s are watching the corresponding issues; you can **mention** a team if you're not sure about who could be your mentor.
